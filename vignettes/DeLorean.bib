	abstract = {We present a computational method for identifying potential targets of a transcription factor ({TF}) using wild-type gene expression time series data. For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the {TF} is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two {TFs}, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the {ChIP}-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with {TF} expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Regulation of gene expression is fundamental to the operation of a cell. Revealing the structure and dynamics of a gene regulatory network ({GRN}) is of great interest and represents a considerably challenging computational problem. The {GRN} estimation problem is complicated by the fact that the number of gene expression measurements is typically extremely small when compared with the dimension of the biological system. Further, because the gene regulation process is intrinsically complex, commonly used parametric models can provide too simple description of the underlying phenomena and, thus, can be unreliable. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for the inference of {GRNs} from time-series and steady-state gene expression measurements. The presented framework is based on the use of Bayesian analysis with ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}) and non-parametric Gaussian process modeling for the transcriptional-level regulation.
Results: The performance of the proposed structure inference method is evaluated using a recently published in vivo dataset. By comparing the obtained results with those of existing {ODE}- and Bayesian-based inference methods we demonstrate that the proposed method provides more accurate network structure learning. The predictive capabilities of the method are examined by splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set and by predicting the test set based on the training set.
Availability: A {MATLAB} implementation of the method will be available from http://www.cs.tut.fi/{\textasciitilde}aijo2/gp upon publication

	abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct—but often complementary—information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as {MDI} (Multiple Dataset Integration). {MDI} can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation ({DMA}) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets.
Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that {MDI} is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that {MDI}’s performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation–chip and protein–protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques—as well as to non-integrative approaches—demonstrate that {MDI} is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.
Availability: A Matlab implementation of {MDI} is available from http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/software/.

	abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected {RNAs} or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells ({BMDCs}) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger {RNA} abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by {RNA}-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of {BMDCs}; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

Here we sequence single-cell {RNA}-seq libraries prepared from over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given messenger {RNA} and the transcript’s level within expressing cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a ‘core’ module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few ‘precocious’ cells in response to uniform stimulation with a pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably, preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially reduces variability between cells in the expression of an early-induced ‘peaked’ inflammatory module, suggesting that paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic responses.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Cell populations are never truly homogeneous; individual cells exist in biochemical states that define functional differences between them. New technology based on microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative polymerase chain reactions now enables high-throughput single-cell gene expression measurement, allowing assessment of cellular heterogeneity. However, few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reactions data.
Results: We present a statistical framework for the exploration, quality control and analysis of single-cell gene expression data from microfluidic arrays. We assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell expression and develop quality control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements. We propose a statistical model accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level can be on (and a continuous expression measure is recorded) or dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). Based on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for differential expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. Using an experiment that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the zero-inflated data. Although developed for measurements from a specific platform (Fluidigm), these tools are generalizable to other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events.

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell {RNA}-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

	abstract = {Despite years of research, the reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotency remains a slow, inefficient process, and a detailed mechanistic understanding of reprogramming remains elusive. Current models suggest reprogramming to pluripotency occurs in two-phases: a prolonged stochastic phase followed by a rapid deterministic phase. In this paradigm, the early stochastic phase is marked by the random and gradual expression of pluripotency genes and is thought to be a major rate-limiting step in the successful generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ({iPSCs}). Recent evidence suggests that the epigenetic landscape of the somatic cell is gradually reset during a period known as the stochastic phase, but it is known neither how this occurs nor what rate-limiting steps control progress through the stochastic phase. A precise understanding of gene expression dynamics in the stochastic phase is required in order to answer these questions. Moreover, a precise model of this complex process will enable the measurement and mechanistic dissection of treatments that enhance the rate or efficiency of reprogramming to pluripotency. Here we use single-cell transcript profiling, {FACS} and mathematical modeling to show that the stochastic phase is an ordered probabilistic process with independent gene-specific dynamics. We also show that partially reprogrammed cells infected with {OSKM} follow two trajectories: a productive trajectory toward increasingly {ESC}-like expression profiles or an alternative trajectory leading away from both the fibroblast and {ESC} state. These two pathways are distinguished by the coordinated expression of a small group of chromatin modifiers in the productive trajectory, supporting the notion that chromatin remodeling is essential for successful reprogramming. These are the first results to show that the stochastic phase of reprogramming in human fibroblasts is an ordered, probabilistic process with gene-specific dynamics and to provide a precise mathematical framework describing the dynamics of pluripotency gene expression during reprogramming by {OSKM}.},

	abstract = {Advances in high-throughput, single cell gene expression are allowing interrogation of cell heterogeneity. However, there is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level. We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three phases and three cell lines. We determine each cell's phase non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments. To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the cell cycle explains only 5\%–17\% of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome., Recent technological advances have enabled the measurement of gene expression in individual cells, revealing that there is substantial variability in expression, even within a homogeneous cell population. In this paper, we develop new analytical methods that account for the intrinsic, stochastic nature of single cell expression in order to characterize the effect of cell cycle on gene expression at the single-cell level. Applying these methods to populations of asynchronously cycling cells, we are able to identify large numbers of genes with cell cycle-associated expression patterns. By measuring and adjusting for cellular-level factors, we are able to derive estimates of co-expressing gene networks that more closely reflect cellular-level processes as opposed to sample-level processes. We find that cell cycle phase only accounts for a modest amount of the overall variability of gene expression within an individual cell. The analytical methods demonstrated in this paper are universally applicable to single cell expression data and represent a promising tool to the scientific community.},

The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves—all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types.

	abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell experiments of cells from the early mouse embryo yield gene expression data for different developmental stages from zygote to blastocyst. To better understand cell fate decisions during differentiation, it is desirable to analyse the high-dimensional gene expression data and assess differences in gene expression patterns between different developmental stages as well as within developmental stages. Conventional methods include univariate analyses of distributions of genes at different stages or multivariate linear methods such as principal component analysis ({PCA}). However, these approaches often fail to resolve important differences as each lineage has a unique gene expression pattern which changes gradually over time yielding different gene expressions both between different developmental stages as well as heterogeneous distributions at a specific stage. Furthermore, to date, no approach taking the temporal structure of the data into account has been presented.
Results: We present a novel framework based on Gaussian process latent variable models ({GPLVMs}) to analyse single-cell {qPCR} expression data of 48 genes from mouse zygote to blastocyst as presented by (Guo et al., 2010). We extend {GPLVMs} by introducing gene relevance maps and gradient plots to provide interpretability as in the linear case. Furthermore, we take the temporal group structure of the data into account and introduce a new factor in the {GPLVM} likelihood which ensures that small distances are preserved for cells from the same developmental stage. Using our novel framework, it is possible to resolve differences in gene expressions for all developmental stages. Furthermore, a new subpopulation of cells within the 16-cell stage is identified which is significantly more trophectoderm-like than the rest of the population. The trophectoderm-like subpopulation was characterized by considerable differences in the expression of Id2, Gata4 and, to a smaller extent, Klf4 and Hand1. The relevance of Id2 as early markers for {TE} cells is consistent with previously published results.
Availability: The mappings were implemented based on Prof. Neil Lawrence's {FGPLVM} toolbox1; extensions for relevance analysis and including the structure of the data can be obtained from one of the authors' homepage.2

	abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput single-cell quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}) is a promising technique allowing for new insights in complex cellular processes. However, the {PCR} reaction can be detected only up to a certain detection limit, whereas failed reactions could be due to low or absent expression, and the true expression level is unknown. Because this censoring can occur for high proportions of the data, it is one of the main challenges when dealing with single-cell {qPCR} data. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) is an important tool for visualizing the structure of high-dimensional data as well as for identifying subpopulations of cells. However, to date it is not clear how to perform a {PCA} of censored data. We present a probabilistic approach that accounts for the censoring and evaluate it for two typical datasets containing single-cell {qPCR} data.
Results: We use the Gaussian process latent variable model framework to account for censoring by introducing an appropriate noise model and allowing a different kernel for each dimension. We evaluate this new approach for two typical {qPCR} datasets (of mouse embryonic stem cells and blood stem/progenitor cells, respectively) by performing linear and non-linear probabilistic {PCA}. Taking the censoring into account results in a 2D representation of the data, which better reflects its known structure: in both datasets, our new approach results in a better separation of known cell types and is able to reveal subpopulations in one dataset that could not be resolved using standard {PCA}.
Availability and implementation: The implementation was based on the existing Gaussian process latent variable model toolbox (https://github.com/{SheffieldML}/{GPmat}); extensions for noise models and kernels accounting for censoring are available at http://icb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/censgplvm.

Three distinct cell types are present within the 64-cell stage mouse blastocyst. We have investigated cellular development up to this stage using single-cell expression analysis of more than 500 cells. The 48 genes analyzed were selected in part based on a whole-embryo analysis of more than 800 transcription factors. We show that in the morula, blastomeres coexpress transcription factors specific to different lineages, but by the 64-cell stage three cell types can be clearly distinguished according to their quantitative expression profiles. We identify Id2 and Sox2 as the earliest markers of outer and inner cells, respectively. This is followed by an inverse correlation in expression for the receptor-ligand pair Fgfr2/Fgf4 in the early inner cell mass. Position and signaling events appear to precede the maturation of the transcriptional program. These results illustrate the power of single-cell expression analysis to provide insight into developmental mechanisms. The technique should be widely applicable to other biological systems.},

While several advanced methods exist for differential expression analysis of {RNA}-seq data, proper tools to anal.yze {RNA}-seq time-course have not been proposed., Results: In this study, we use {RNA}-seq to measure gene expression during the early human T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and T-cell activation (Th0). To quantify Th17-specific gene expression dynamics, we present a novel statistical methodology, {DyNB}, for analyzing time-course {RNA}-seq data. We use non-parametric Gaussian processes to model temporal correlation in gene expression and combine that with negative binomial likelihood for the count data. To account for experiment-specific biases in gene expression dynamics, such as differences in cell differentiation efficiencies, we propose a method to rescale the dynamics between replicated measurements. We develop an {MCMC} sampling method to make inference of differential expression dynamics between conditions. {DyNB} identifies several known and novel genes involved in Th17 differentiation. Analysis of differentiation efficiencies revealed consistent patterns in gene expression dynamics between different cultures. We use {qRT}-{PCR} to validate differential expression and differentiation efficiencies for selected genes. Comparison of the results with those obtained via traditional timepoint-wise analysis shows that time-course analysis together with time rescaling between cultures identifies differentially expressed genes which would not otherwise be detected., Availability: An implementation of the proposed computational methods will be available at http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/, Contact:

	abstract = {Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for an organism's response to environmental change is an important issue in molecular biology. A first and important step towards this goal is to detect genes whose expression levels are affected by altered external conditions. A range of methods to test for differential gene expression, both in static as well as in time-course experiments, have been proposed. While these tests answer the question whether a gene is differentially expressed, they do not explicitly address the question when a gene is differentially expressed, although this information may provide insights into the course and causal structure of regulatory programs. In this article, we propose a two-sample test for identifying intervals of differential gene expression in microarray time series. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression, can deal with arbitrary numbers of replicates, and is robust with respect to outliers. We apply our algorithm to study the response of Arabidopsis thaliana genes to an infection by a fungal pathogen using a microarray time series dataset covering 30,336 gene probes at 24 observed time points. In classification experiments, our test compares favorably with existing methods and provides additional insights into time-dependent differential expression.},

Many individual components and pathways operating during plant defense have been identified, but our knowledge of how these different components interact is still rudimentary. We generated a high-resolution time series of gene expression profiles from a single Arabidopsis thaliana leaf during infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for {TGA}3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens. These data provide an unprecedented level of detail about transcriptional changes during a defense response and are suited to systems biology analyses to generate predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating the Arabidopsis response to B. cinerea.},

Researchers have studied the regulation of the cell cycle in several organisms, employing a wide range of high-throughput technologies, such as microarray-based {mRNA} expression profiling and quantitative proteomics. Due to its complexity, the cell cycle can also fail or otherwise change in many different ways if important genes are knocked out, which has been studied in several microscopy-based knockdown screens. The data from these many large-scale efforts are not easily accessed, analyzed and combined due to their inherent heterogeneity. To address this, we have created Cyclebase—available at http://www.cyclebase.org—an online database that allows users to easily visualize and download results from genome-wide cell-cycle-related experiments. In Cyclebase version 3.0, we have updated the content of the database to reflect changes to genome annotation, added new {mRNA} and protein expression data, and integrated cell-cycle phenotype information from high-content screens and model-organism databases. The new version of Cyclebase also features a new web interface, designed around an overview figure that summarizes all the cell-cycle-related data for a gene.},

We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model ({scLVM}) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The computational analysis of genetical genomics studies is challenged by confounding variation that is unrelated to the genetic factors of interest. Several approaches to account for these confounding factors have been proposed, greatly increasing the sensitivity in recovering direct genetic (cis) associations between variable genetic loci and the expression levels of individual genes. Crucially, these existing techniques largely rely on the true association signals being orthogonal to the confounding variation. Here, we show that when studying indirect (trans) genetic effects, for example from master regulators, their association signals can overlap with confounding factors estimated using existing methods. This technical overlap can lead to overcorrection, erroneously explaining away true associations as confounders. To address these shortcomings, we propose {PANAMA}, a model that jointly learns hidden factors while accounting for the effect of selected genetic regulators. In applications to several studies, {PANAMA} is more accurate than existing methods in recovering the hidden confounding factors. As a result, we find an increase in the statistical power for direct (cis) and indirect (trans) associations. Most strikingly on yeast, {PANAMA} not only finds additional associations but also identifies master regulators that can be better reproduced between independent studies.},

	abstract = {Stem cells undergo a shift in metabolic substrate utilization during specification and/or differentiation, a process that has been termed metabolic reprogramming. Here, we report that during the transition from quiescence to proliferation, skeletal muscle stem cells experience a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. This reprogramming of cellular metabolism decreases intracellular {NAD}+ levels and the activity of the histone deacetylase {SIRT}1, leading to elevated H4K16 acetylation and activation of muscle gene transcription. Selective genetic ablation of the {SIRT}1 deacetylase domain in skeletal muscle results in increased H4K16 acetylation and deregulated activation of the myogenic program in {SCs}. Moreover, mice with muscle-specific inactivation of the {SIRT}1 deacetylase domain display reduced myofiber size, impaired muscle regeneration, and derepression of muscle developmental genes. Overall, these findings reveal how metabolic cues can be mechanistically translated into epigenetic modifications that regulate skeletal muscle stem cell biology.},

	abstract = {Systems biology approaches are extensively used to model and reverse engineer gene regulatory networks from experimental data. Conversely, synthetic biology allows “de novo” construction of a regulatory network to seed new functions in the cell. At present, the usefulness and predictive ability of modeling and reverse engineering cannot be assessed and compared rigorously. We built in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic network, {IRMA}, for in vivo “benchmarking” of reverse-engineering and modeling approaches. The network is composed of five genes regulating each other through a variety of regulatory interactions; it is negligibly affected by endogenous genes, and it is responsive to small molecules. We measured time series and steady-state expression data after multiple perturbations. These data were used to assess state-of-the-art modeling and reverse-engineering techniques. A semiquantitative model was able to capture and predict the behavior of the network. Reverse engineering based on differential equations and Bayesian networks correctly inferred regulatory interactions from the experimental data.},

We explored the underlying mechanism of this switch by using {RNA}-Seq transcriptome analysis at the resolution of single cells. We detected significant molecular transitions and major changes in transcript variants, which include genes for general metabolism. Furthermore, the expression of repressive epigenetic regulators increased with a concomitant decrease in gene activators that might be necessary to sustain the inherent plasticity of {ESCs}. Furthermore, we detected changes in {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}), with one set that targets early differentiation genes while another set targets pluripotency genes to maintain the unique {ESC} epigenotype. Such genetic and epigenetic events may contribute to a switch from a normal developmental program in adult cells during the formation of diseased tissues, including cancers.},

	abstract = {"Gaussian processes ({GPs}) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. {GPs} have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of {GPs} in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics."--Jacket.},
